            <h3 align= center><i>Rating the All-In-One Personality test</i></h3>
            <p align= center>
                On a scale of 1-10, I rate this test a <strong>7.5</strong>. <br>There are some characteristics that this test concluded about <br>me which I definitely do not agree with. Take for example,<wbr> there is not an alternate universe where I would ever come off as "needy". <br>I do agree however that I am introverted and prefer to be alone and I am<br> not preocupied with others' opinion of myself.<br>
                I am certainly not narcissistic however I will confess that I really am a <br>bit paranoid and I do find ut difficut to trust others. I have been told before that I am<br> obsessive compulsive so I concur with that assessment as well as the fact that<br> I, as much as is possible, am avoidant of socual interactions.
