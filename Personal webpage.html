        <h3>Who is Monique?></h3>
        <p valign= right>For starters, Monique is a 20 years old student enrolled at the University of Technology: currently in her second year pursuing a degree in the field of Computer Science</p>
        <br>
        Prior to enrolling at the University of Technology, she attended St. /Jago high school where she served as a deputy head girl in her final year. Throughout high school she was known by many because of her willingness to speak up whenever there was a misuse or abuse of power.
        <br>
        Undoubtedly, this was not something with which the administration was always pleased about but nevertheless, she maintained good relations with those in authority and avoided trouble at all costs.

        <a name = "likes" href="">Likes</a>
        <p>
            I ABSOLUTELY LOVE FOOD! Food always has the capability to lift my spirits effortlessly. Of course I do have some favorites (eg chocolate, rice and peas etc), but I love food in general.
            <br>
            I also very much appreciate peace and quiet. I can only tolerate noise when I am the one making it. For this reason, I am often by myself most of the time.
        </p>

        <a name= "dislikes" href="">Dislikes</a>
        <p>
            I hate losing. 
        </p>

        <a name = "hobbies" href="">Hobbies</a>
        <p>
            My top two hobbies in no particular order would definitely be playing volleyball and shopping. Both activities, like food, always get me excited and chirpy on gloomy days.
